## Assessment

Develop a simple scheduling application for a team of software developers in 'Techly.ai' (a startup) to organize activities in order of priority using the T3 Tech-Stack. The user requirement of the application is as follows:

- The application should have an interactive sortable list
- The user should be able to add an item to the list
- The user should be able to edit and delete any existing item on the list
- The user should be able to sort the priority of a list item using drag-n-drop
- The state of the list should persist using a database
- The application should be accessible online, deploy the application on a cloud platform of your choice

The application should use the following libraries so that it integrates well with the rest of the services in Techly.ai:

- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) for managing database
- [dnd-kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/) for creating a sortable list

You can find detailed information on which stack to use below.
